            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
              We celebrated the 20th anniversary of PyCon US, welcoming 2,159
              attendees in Salt Lake City, and 491 joining the online event.
              From the first tutorial session to the last day of sprints, we
              learned, connected, collaborated, and had a lot of fun. Under our
              Program Director Olivia Sauls‚Äô leadership, a huge team of
              volunteers, speakers, presenters, staff, and sponsors came
              together to make it all possible, and the attendees brought their
              curiosity, knowledge, friendliness, and that special PyCon US
              energy that makes it a highlight of each year.

                <p class="text-gray-600">BY MARIATTA WIJAYA, PYCON US CHAIR</p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Back in 2015, I received financial aid through PyLadies for
              attending the conference, and it kickstarted my journey in the
              Python community.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Seeing many women speaking at PyCon US was what inspired me to
              start speaking at conferences too, which in turn started a new
              personal tradition of doing ice cream selfies after giving a talk
              at a conference as a way to reward myself.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
              It was also at PyCon US 2015 that I listened to the keynote speech
              from Guido van Rossum regarding diversity issues in the core
              Python team, and how at that point there were no women as Python
              core developers at all, and that the Python Language Summit was
              attended by 50 men. Up to that point I didn‚Äôt even know that there
              was such a thing called ‚ÄúPython core developer‚Äù. It made me
              realize that I didn‚Äôt know much about the Python community at all.
              The speech inspired me to be more involved in the Python community
              and to eventually become a Python core developer myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did not expect to one day be the one chairing the PyCon US
              conference myself. Without the financial aid and support from
              PyLadies and the Python community, I would not be where I am
              today.

              <li>Strive for healthy debate and consensus</li>

              this wonderful board and it‚Äôs been an honor to serve in this role.

              We‚Äôre thrilled that our global interest in Latin American, Asian,

              regional leaders with specific requests to address the
              underrepresented global audience. We are ready to roll up our
              sleeves and continue to support the Python community globally.

              2023 was the year of collaboration‚Äîfrom CPython internals, through
              process improvements for Python development, all the way to

            The biggest news is the acceptance of
            <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP 703</a> by the
            Steering Council, and the resulting work towards bringing it to
            light. If you‚Äôre not familiar with the cryptic combination of a
            three-letter acronym and numbers, PEP 703 is the design document
            that describes how Python can make the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
            optional. It‚Äôs a change of unprecedented magnitude in Python, and
            with that comes the need for unprecedented caution. Sam Gross, the
            author of the PEP, described not only a feasible way to build a
            usable Python without the GIL, but
            <a href="https://github.com/colesbury/nogil/"
              >provided a proof-of-concept implementation</a

              >bringing it under discussion</a
            >
            with other core developers, formalized it in the form of a PEP, and
            sponsored it under his role as a CPython developer.

            At the same time, the core team is working on equally impressive
            changes like a Just-in-Time compiler, which requires additional
            testing. ≈Åukasz worked on maintaining the buildbot fleet, improving
            the performance of the
            <a href="https://buildbot.python.org/all/#/release_status"
              >front-end</a

            Pull Requests, fixing macOS build failures, and triaging issues when
            they popped up. In particular, the big memory buildbot caught a
            number of unique bugs!

              The Python Core Developers met for a dedicated core sprint week in

              was a particularly fun and productive week. ≈Åukasz worked with
              Mariatta Wijaya on upgrading some bots to serve as GitHub apps,
              which aligns them with the current requirements of the platform.
              During 2023, ≈Åukasz reviewed and merged close to 500 pull requests
              within the Python organization on GitHub, most of them authored by
              other Core Developers.

              A few of those upgrades were security improvements, like requiring
              second-factor authentication for all Python organization members
              on GitHub and adopting Sigstore as the technology to sign Python
              releases with signature and key transparency logs. ≈Åukasz

              Motivated by attacks on the software supply chain, exploitation of
              software vulnerabilities, and new regulations from governments,
              users are looking for solutions to maintain safety and integrity
              while participating in open source software ecosystems.
              Maintainers of open source want their projects to be secure, but
              in many cases there is a gap in time, resources, and tooling that

          To address these needs in the Python ecosystem, the Python Software

          in June 2023. This position was possible thanks to grant funding from
          <a href="https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/">Alpha-Omega</a>.
          The role has the mandate to improve the security posture of the entire
          Python ecosystem, including the Python runtime, Python packages, and
          infrastructure like the Python Package Index (PyPi). You can follow

          The first project was to improve Python‚Äôs ability to manage and
          publish vulnerabilities. Our vulnerability management process before
          was driven entirely by external organizations like MITRE who would
          assign CVEs on behalf of reporters, sometimes without consulting
          Python‚Äôs Security Response Team. This resulted in CVEs that sometimes
          were incorrect, confusing to users, or didn‚Äôt contain all the
          information needed to remediate like patches and work-arounds.

            Next was a focus on hardening CPython‚Äôs release process. Supply
            chain attacks against open source software tend to focus on the
            release process due to being ephemeral and thus difficult to detect
            an intrusion compared to merging attacks into the public source
            code. CPython‚Äôs release process is quite complex,

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            There were multiple improvements made to the release process,

              >Sigstore signatures of CPython artifacts</a

            for consistency, making builds of CPython reproducible byte-for-byte
            to detect injected code, and moving the build from release managers‚Äô
            machines to an isolated and repeatable environment like GitHub
            Actions. All of this work happened with the involvement of Python
            release managers to ensure the process changes fit with their
            existing working model.

            2024 is likely to bring new challenges and having full-time staffing
            to engage early will mean Python can continue being a leader
            regarding supply chain security. We look forward to continued
            interest and support of a secure Python ecosystem for everyone.

              Convention Center for the second year of PyCon US in Salt Lake
              City, Utah, and for the 20th Anniversary Celebration of PyCon US.
              The mountainscape and spring weather of Salt Lake City provided a
              beautiful backdrop for an energizing and inspirational 9-day PyCon
              US 2023 conference, filled with Tutorials, Talks, Sponsor
              Presentations, Sprints, Summits, and Keynotes, promoting the theme
              ‚ÄúBy the community, For the community‚Äù. This year, PyCon US
              reintroduced 4 days of the post-conference Development Sprints for
              the first time since gathering in-person again.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-4">
              Live-streaming of the main conference days returned for the second
              year via the PyCon US 2023 virtual platform, Hubilo, with the new
              feature of providing access to all registered attendees, whether
              registered for online or in-person attendance. PyCon US was also
              able to provide live captioning for all tracks of the main
              conference days, including ‚Äúlive-remote‚Äù captioning for our
              Spanish Charlas Track, to increase and promote diversity and
              accessibility for our community.
